As of now, the following things are implemented:

- a user can register or login (no sh\*t ðŸ˜‘)
- if a user doesn't upload an avatar while registering, a default avatar will be set
- users can create, read, update & delete posts
- view profile of other users ðŸ‘€
- users can post comments on posts
- can save drafts instead of directly publishing the posts\
- user can edit a published post & save those changes as a draft on the server without affecting the published post ðŸ˜Œ
